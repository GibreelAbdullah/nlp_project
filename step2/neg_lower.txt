n dont believe the hype it is a great player and you so much want to love it but it freezes all the time and crashes my pc
n what kind of product is limited in compatibility to one os for those who try to avoid xp this is a problem
n i bought this light after looking on the web it seemed to be sold everywhere however no one seems to have tryed it  it did not even light up the title to my music much less a complete page musicans beware this is mighty dull
n the features on this unit are nice but in my experience its poorly manufactured i had two die in under three weeks from getting the first one
n is far greater than this product should getjust as the other reviews stated its worthlessdont buy it
n it is not repairable not honored by the warrantee and samsung basically washes its hands because of their own poor quality casing design
n this product its bad at the second time ive used it broke out and it can be use
n i ordered this item on march  but not shipped until todayapril  why
n bought the sucker in july and in october it died inexplicably would never buy another piece of junk from creative
n like many other negative reviews ive experienced the same problems with this razor i guess less blades is more and im going back to the m power
n it is not ready for market do not touch it
n happy with the service but the product has been giving us problems it has problems finding the computer and doesnt work half the time
n if apple makes everthing works as it advertized then its worth it
n it was great until it broke  months in doesnt play anymore i am not impressed
n it sucks so bad its over expensive and cant do anything get a sansa
n they dont display all of the informationthis product doesnt come with cimbolswasnt worth what i payed for itdont buy thes set
n this mp player broke as soon as i tried to use the player it only turned on once and would never could be turned on again
n sovietera luxury indian stylewhat a dump stay at hotels such as oberoi which are in a similar price range but deliver firstclass amenities and services on all fronts
n this is the second one we got  the first one was doa this one died after a couple weeks  no reason just ceased to work
n no kidding the shipping charge on these batteries was over  amazon doesnt itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wont know that youre being raped by crutchfield until it is too late
