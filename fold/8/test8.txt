+ business pleasurei found the ambassador hotel very convenient it is certainly welllocated next to the airport the rooms are clean and comfortable no complanits about the service
- i found this little device a bit complicated and the instructions were not clear to me i gave up
- ive only got this thing to work for about  hours and that is not in a row ive spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks
- it so cheap in quality almost seems like a toy this items should be in the price range of 
- worst quality i have ever seen  bought three and all three are horrble scratched screws wo not tighten shocked by the lack of quality control
- it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i would not even use this for a notebook
- as the other reviewer found out these cards ca not be formatted to work with sd audio total waste of money
- some much better out there suprisingly over priced for what you get
- absolutely no use to me whatsoever next
- it is very difficult to download upload it crashes a lot and it give you a lot of warnings i regreet to buy this itemspsks
- the itouch i recieved was defective bad battery im still in process of replacing it
- very bad hotelmy personal experience in this hotel was bad  hotel was dirty and staff was bad and greedy always making extra money from tourist by charging so many hidden and not mentioned taxes i truly never recommend to any tourist
- i had this for about  months before it broke customer service never returned my emails
- it should be stateed this item is for  years and younger very small for older kid
- i am  and this jump rope was too short for me it says that its adujustable but it can only be made shorter and not longer for a kid this is a good jump rope but its definitely not for a tall person
- why would anyone buy this when you can get a gb ipod that will hold  times the number of songs and even more if aac encoding is used for the same price in addition  ipods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info
- it just stopped working after a couple months i tossed it out and got a gb sandisk do not buy this player
- the product itself is average ive used better and worse that said its definitely not worth the full asking price
