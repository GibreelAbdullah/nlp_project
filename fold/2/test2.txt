- after a year the lifedrive froze while starting up i tried resetting including several hard resets which the unit would never complete
- meditation will do the same thing buy a tape or take a class
- only someone who is from another planet would buy this player it has problems playing mp and wma files it forces you to use the dumb sony software it costs more than an ipod in short buy something else
+ i feel i got the best deal all year my daughter loved it and amazon made sure i could afford it walmart and target have nothing on amazon
-  for more than a couple of minutes no matter what i did and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke ive gotten much better results for the same money with other products
- the software on the rca kazoo is almost impossible for me to figure out the rca kazoos headphones also are bad i think it is too expensive for what its worth and i am asking you not to buy this peice of junk
- i do not know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles its basically just gatorade with more sugar in it if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere
+ i have absolutely no complaints super easy to use and im a gadgetidiot great for runing
+ this metronome shows the different italian terms used to describe tempos this makes it easier to know at what tempo to practice your music
+ this mp player is very user friendly and easy to follow directions for getting started also love the clip on
- do not buy iriver products unless you do not want customer service cuz they do not have any
- music loaded fine but the mode button was broken therefore the player would not play i had to send it back
+ perfect size easy to use fm tuner is nice to have for someone who does not need an overly abundant amount of songs on their mp this is great
- it list good specs but i would not know as it does not work with xp home and there are noe firmware updates drivers for it the companies web site is pathetic with no forums or any way to give feedback it might make a good paper weight tho
- this is a piece of junk with lcd display defect in the first place do not buy it
+ this is a great product for the money for a novice it was easy to use the instructions were pretty thin but it was simple to figure out a useful tool
+ this was my grandsos present last year from his mom and dad he loves it
- it plays videos but according to the apple website you get two hours of video playback before your battery drains crash and burn
+ delhi bellygood service nice and clean too much attention sometimes from service staff nice with gym inside the hotel
+ there is just one word to describe this product amazing im full satisfied with it just buy it with mbytes mine is kbytes one last thing the battery lasts forever
+ this is by far the best flashbased mp player i have ever used it is incredibly user friendly great sound and picture with all the bells and whistles
+ the ipod is great it got here in good time and great shape it has plenty of memory to hold tons of music it is a great size to carry around and use anywhere anytime
- the ipod is better more popular and more compatible why go against the grain do the right thing and go apple
+ battery life is great  and the sd card extention is nice you can add a gb card no problem
+ great features probably the best pedometer out there for the money the only reason i give  vice  stars is that i think the one i bought for my mom same brand and model is slightly more accurate a great way to track your fitness overall
+ fast and accurate 
+ great gadget decent price lots of options what else do you need
+ nano sounds gr i m very happy with the sound i hear compared to a old mp player i had and also very sleek and easy to use
- seems i may have already broke this bar  twisted it to stop it from spining while i was doing exercise and heard a pop now it spins all the time i use it  not happy  i did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already
+ it went through the washing machine all the way through to spin and still worked new headphones were required what more can i say
+ this is the greatest mp player out there i never even installed the software for song transfer i love it
+ very compact size weight is great for clipping onto workout wear easy to use great sound great little screen good battery love it 
- it does not have a lcd screen although you can customize the playlist i just ca not remember the order of the songs waste of money
- pfft waste of money i loved it until my screen faded and consequentally went black after  months rendering it useless
- maybe if these were high end rechargable nimh this would be a reasonable price but for alkaline this is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell you can find aaa battieries on amazon for a third of this price
- i opened this downloaded a few files listened for  minutes and then nothing what a waste not worth it at any price
- never buy any product from rio ever this is a horible product and i could not get anyone to tell me how to get it to work i was absolutly horrible
+ this product is really versatile for my needs i can listen to music watch videos and most importantly store my photos while on the go
- screen died within  weeks had to return it think i will go in another direction
- buy this item and the right forward button next will not work it is unfortunate
- the first time i used these pushup bars the flimsy plastic theyre made out of cracked in three different places perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely but im not going to risk an injury finding out in the trash they go i suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
- first of all i got a white ipod i ordered black but other than that it came pretty slow and it was missing the installation disc
- shuffle setting is not random plays different order but that same diferent order every time the headphones stink
+ this wiffle bat is light and easy to use substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse it will not hurt the horse but will get the horses attention
- beware of this product it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer i have another usb  card reader that works perfectly i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb  but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
+ got a gen  and a gen  for my son and daughter she wanted a gen  since that is what her friends have she saw the gen  and changed her mind
- when this unit works it is a great idea mine froze up on me and i was forced to return it
+ its cheaper easytouse has a screen so you can select songs albums and fits more music oh and it has a pretty good battery life
-  but in this case an inferior product there are better ones out there with more functionality and better quality
- it did not work from first time i could not start it did not charge pure aggrevation
- the battery will eventually wear out but becase of integrated battery type in this device it is likely you will be in hard time of replacing it
- it is so easy to break
- specs say  hours get maybe  then have to turn of batter life switch and back on
